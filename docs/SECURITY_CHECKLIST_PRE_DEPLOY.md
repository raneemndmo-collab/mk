# MonthlyKey — Pre-Deploy Security Checklist

**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** 2026-02-26  
**Classification:** Internal — Engineering & DevOps  
**Compliance note:** No Beds24 changes. No Mansun dependency added.

---

## Purpose

This checklist must be completed before every production deployment. Each item includes a verification command or manual step. A deployment **must not proceed** if any P0 item fails. P1 items should be resolved within 48 hours of deployment; P2 items are tracked in the backlog.

## Deployment Gate Rules

A deployment is **blocked** if any of the following conditions are true:

1. Any **P0** item has status ☐ (unchecked).
2. The `JWT_SECRET` environment variable is missing or matches the default fallback.
3. The admin seed password has not been changed from `15001500`.
4. `npm audit` reports any **critical** severity vulnerability.
5. The orphan record detection query returns any non-zero count.

A deployment **proceeds with tracking** if:

1. All P0 items are ☑.
2. P1 items that are ☐ have been logged as tickets with a 48-hour SLA.
3. P2 items that are ☐ have been added to the sprint backlog.

**No Beds24 changes.** This checklist does not include any items that modify Beds24 integration.  
**No Mansun dependency added.** All verification commands use standard tools (curl, grep, mysql, node).
