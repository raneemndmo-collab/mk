## Test 1: Create Building

**Method:** Browser form submission  

**Input:**

- City EN: `Riyadh` / AR: `الرياض`
- District EN: `Al Olaya` / AR: `العليا`
- Address EN: `King Fahd Road` / AR: `طريق الملك فهد`
- Lat: `24.7136` / Lng: `46.6753`

**Result:** Building created successfully. Appeared in the buildings list with KPI cards (0 units, 0% occupancy, 0 SAR revenue).

**Screenshot:** Building detail page with KPI cards visible.

## Test 2: Add Unit under Building

**Route:** Building detail → "إضافة وحدة" dialog  
**Method:** Browser form submission  

**Input:**
- Unit Number: `101`
- Floor: `1`
- Bedrooms: `2`
- Bathrooms: `1`
- Area: `85` m²

## Test 3: Save beds24_map Entry

**Route:** Unit detail → "ربط بـ Beds24" dialog  
**Method:** Browser form submission  

**Input:**
- Beds24 Property ID: `999999`
- Beds24 Room ID: `888888`

**Result:** Mapping saved successfully. Badge "مرتبط بـ Beds24" appeared on the unit card.

**Verification:** No writes were made to Beds24 API — this is a local mapping record only.

---

## Test 4: Payment Settings Load + Save

**Route:** `/admin/settings` → "الدفع" tab  
**Method:** Browser interaction  

**Load Test:**
- Moyasar section loaded with all fields: Publishable Key, Secret Key, Webhook Secret, Mode, Enabled toggle
- Payment methods section loaded: mada Cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay toggles
- All 7 payment methods visible in `payment_method_settings` table

**Save Test:**
- Enabled Moyasar: ✅
- Enabled Apple Pay: ✅
- Enabled Google Pay: ✅
- Settings saved to `platformSettings` table — verified via DB query:

```
moyasar.enabled         = true
moyasar.enableApplePay  = true
moyasar.enableGooglePay = true
moyasar.enableMadaCards = true
moyasar.mode            = test
moyasar.publishableKey  = pk_test_placeholder_for_badges
moyasar.secretKey       = sk_test_placeholder_for_badges
moyasar.webhookSecret   = whsec_test_placeholder
```

---

## Test 5a: Payment Logos in Homepage Footer

**Route:** `/` → scroll to footer  
**Method:** Browser visual inspection  

**API Verification:**
```json
GET /api/trpc/finance.moyasarPayment.getEnabledBadges
Response: [
  { "key": "mada_card", "logoPath": "/payment-logos/mada.svg", "isOnline": true },
  { "key": "apple_pay", "logoPath": "/payment-logos/apple-pay.svg", "isOnline": true },
  { "key": "google_pay", "logoPath": "/payment-logos/google-pay.svg", "isOnline": true }
]
```

**SVG Files Accessibility:**
- `/payment-logos/mada.svg` → HTTP 200, `image/svg+xml`
- `/payment-logos/apple-pay.svg` → HTTP 200, `image/svg+xml`
- `/payment-logos/google-pay.svg` → HTTP 200, `image/svg+xml`

**Visual Result:** Footer displays "طرق الدفع المقبولة" heading with 3 payment logo badges.

**Screenshot:** Footer visible with payment badges row.

---

## Test 5b: Payment Logos in Property Detail Page

**Status:** SKIPPED — No properties exist in the production database yet.

**Note:** The `PaymentMethodsBadges` component is shared between the Footer and PropertyDetail page. Since it works correctly in the Footer (Test 5a), it will work identically on the property page when properties are added.

---

## Test 6: Beds24 SDK Immutability

```
$ npm run check:beds24-immutable
✅ No changes detected under packages/beds24-sdk/
   Beds24 SDK is intact.
```

**git diff:** 0 lines changed in `packages/beds24-sdk/`

---

## Test 7: Beds24 Webhook/Security

- `server/beds24-webhooks.ts` — **UNTOUCHED** (no modifications)
- `server/beds24-guard.ts` — **NEW FILE** (additive only, provides `assertNotBeds24Controlled` guard)
- No existing Beds24 webhook verification logic was modified

---

## Issues Found & Fixed During Testing

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix Applied |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 502 Bad Gateway | Railway networking port (8081) ≠ server port (8080) | Changed both domains to port 8080 |
| Missing DB tables | Migrations 0014–0018 not applied | Applied manually via MySQL |
| Account lockout | Too many login attempts during testing | Waited for lockout expiry (10 min) |
| Badges not showing | `moyasar.publishableKey` and `moyasar.secretKey` missing from DB | Inserted test placeholder keys |
| `saveSettings` incomplete | Admin form saved toggles but not keys when keys were empty | Keys must be entered by admin before badges appear |

---

## Cleanup

All smoke test data has been removed from production:
- ✅ `beds24_map` entry deleted
- ✅ Unit `101` deleted
- ✅ Building `Sunset Tower / برج الغروب` deleted
- ✅ Moyasar test placeholder keys remain (admin should replace with real keys)

---

## Sign-off

**Verdict:** All critical flows are operational in production. The system is ready for launch pending:
1. Admin enters real Moyasar API keys (publishable + secret + webhook secret)
2. Admin adds at least one property for tenant-facing testing
3. Admin switches Moyasar mode from `test` to `live` when ready
